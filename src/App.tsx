Here's the fixed version with the missing closing brackets added:

```typescript
// At line 391, add closing bracket for the filteredCards filter:
const filteredCards = flashcards.filter(card => {
  if (selectedFolder === 'all') return true;
  if (selectedFolder === 'uncategorized') return !card.folderId;
  return card.folderId === selectedFolder;
}); // Add closing bracket here

// At the very end of the file, add closing bracket for the FlashcardList component:
export const FlashcardList: React.FC<FlashcardListProps> = ({
  // ... component implementation
}); // Add closing bracket here
```

The main syntax errors were:

1. Missing closing bracket `)` for the filteredCards filter function
2. Missing closing bracket `}` for the FlashcardList component

The rest of the code appears to be properly bracketed. Let me know if you need any clarification!
